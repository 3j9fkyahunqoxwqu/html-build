# HTML Build Tools

This repository contains the tools and instructions necessary for building the [HTML Standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/) from its [source](https://github.com/whatwg/html).

## Prerequisites

Before building, make sure you have the following commands installed on your system.

- `curl`, `egrep`, `git`, `grep`, `perl`, `python`, `svn`, `unzip`, `wget`

You'll also need to have the Perl XML::Parser module installed on your system. It's not a "core" Perl module, so you may have to install it by doing one of the following to either get it using the perl `cpan install` command, or by getting the version packaged for your OS; for example;

- `cpan install XML::parser`
- `apt-get install libxml-parser-perl` (Ubuntu)

## Build

Building your own copy of the HTML Standard from its source requires just two simple steps:

1. Clone this ([html-build](https://github.com/whatwg/html-build)) repo:
```
    git clone https://github.com/whatwg/html-build.git && cd html-build
```

1. Run the `build.sh` script from inside your `html-build` working directory, like this:
```
    ./build.sh
```

## Output

After you complete the build steps above, the build will run and generate the single-page version of the spec, the multipage version, and more. If all goes well, you should very soon have all the following in your `output/` directory:

- `.htaccess`
- `404.html`
- `entities.json`
- `fonts/*`
- `images/*`
- `index`
- `link-fixup.js`
- `multipage/*`

And then you're also ready to edit the `html/source` fileâ€”and after you make your changes, you can run the `build.sh` script again to see the new output.
