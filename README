SETUP
=====

Create a .cldr-data directory that is the SVN checkout of:
   http://www.unicode.org/repos/cldr/trunk/common/main/

Get wattsi and make the "wattsi" binary available on your path:
   http://software.hixie.ch/applications/wattsi/

Then in theory running build.sh inside this directory will generate
the spec, multipage version, entities DTD, and entities JSON file.


NOTES
-----

The following features were lost when I moved to using github to
manage the spec:

* per-topic subscriptions (since Github only does per-repo
  subscriptions, not per-file-subsection subscriptions)

* update notifications

* bug filing
